Why is this okay?

(parse '123) ==> (const 123)
but
(parse 'a) ==> (var a)

Problem:
(parse '123x) ==> (var \x31;23x) 
instead of (var 123x)


Problems:
Define-MIT:
(define a b c d) isn't working

Lambda: - fixed!!!
    lambda's whose body contains more than one expression aren't parsed correctly
    
Begin:
    need to take care of recursive begin
