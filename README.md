# Compilation

Summary:


Left To Do:
- Test sexpr as a whole
- handle comments and whitespaces, there is the code mayer wrote and uploaded but it is still unclear in what staged are we supposed to use these methods to identify these comments/whitespaces.
Perhaps in the infix.
- Infix - test the tokens i wrote, and add packing 
- implement logic between the different infix actions, meaning precenence.

Updates:

Maayan 21/11 - 

	Problem with InfixArrayGet, InfixFuncall, etc..
	The problem is that when we execute (test-string \<InfixExpression> "A[1]")
	the result is that A is matched using  \<InfixSymbol> but the rest of the expression can't be matched, we should have gone to \<InfixArrayGet> first, but we didn't becuase \<InfixSymbol>
	was first.
	On the other hand if we switch their order, (test-string <InfixArrayGet> "A[1]") will enter an infinite loop, becuase it will constantly search for infixExpression, and then enter INfixArrayGet, 		and then InfixExpression and there will never be an end to it..

Maayan 20/11-
  - Added the comments tokens from Mayer's uploaded file.
  - Wrote the definitions for almost all the infix terminals.
  - Changed \<Symbol> to return a string.
  
Maayan 19/11 - 
- Wrote a file including tests to all terminals.
- Tested and corrected (including packing).

Problems:
- In Symbol, if i attempt to make sure the returned value is a symbol then the following scenario occurs:
(test-string \<Symbol> "1")
==>  \x31
Should we return a string then?
- Problem when testing vector:
(test-string <sexpr> "#(#\\Lambda1abc)")
((match #(#\Î» 1 (#\a #\b #\c))) (remaining ""))
there is some type symbol, char or string that causes the returned value of abc to be (#\a #\b #\c), something isn't packed properly..
